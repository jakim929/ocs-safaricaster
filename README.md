# Safaricaster

Safaricaster is a real-time, livestream frame where players spot and mint wildlife fauna NFT at a waterhole in the Namib Desert.

## How it works

Players follow along the [NamibiaCam live stream](https://www.youtube.com/@NamibiaCam/streams) via screenshots in-frame and are alerted by chatGPT when an animal is spotted. This grants players the chance to mint the serendipitous encounter as a personalized NFT. At launch, the stream is set 4 hours behind UTC to align with the majority of Warpcast users' timezones.


Personalized NFTs entail:
* A livestream image of the encounter
* The animal spotted (e.g., cheetah)
* The time of day / timestamp
* The player’s FID & Farcaster username  


Mints cost 0.00099 ETH with proceeds going to Namib Desert conservation. Donations will help ensure the preservation and protection of Namib Desert fauna, plants, and their habitats.

## About NamibiaCam

The NamibiaCam is an independent organization responsible for maintaining and filming the site of the waterhole at GPS coordinates: -24.074923, 15.887410.

_"NamibiaCam’s Namib Desert waterhole lies within the Gondwana Namib Park - bordering the Namib Naukluft Park. Built in 2006, the special character of this waterhole, has not only an impact on the surrounding wildlife, but stretches across the globe, from home to home through live streaming. This particular waterhole is situated within an open plain, 8km from Namib Desert Lodge. A solar-powered borehole fills a nearby reservoir and is monitored by a water float that opens as the waterhole’s levels decline. Being situated within a remote destination like the Namib Desert, intermittent interruptions are likely to occur at times."_
