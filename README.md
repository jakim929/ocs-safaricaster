# Safaricaster

Safaricaster is a real-time, frame game where players spot and mint wildlife fauna NFT at a waterhole in the Namibia Desert.

## How it works

Players follow along the [NamibiaCam live stream](https://www.youtube.com/@NamibiaCam/streams) via screenshots in-frame and are alerted by chatGPT when an animal is spotted. This grants players the chance to mint the serendipitous encounter as a personalized NFT.   


Personalized NFTs entail:
* A livestream image of the encounter
* The animal spotted (e.g., cheetah)
* The time of day / timestamp
* The player’s FID & Farcaster username  


Mints cost 0.00099 ETH with proceeds going entirely to [The Narrative Namibia](https://narrativenamibia.com/products/donate-to-the-waterhole?utm_campaign=NamibiaCam&utm_content=279546882&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&hss_channel=fbp-105769169133131). Donations help maintain and improve the Namib Desert waterhole, the equipment and cameras, and the funding of new cameras in Namibia.

## About NamibiaCam

The NamibiaCam is an independent organization responsible for maintaining and filming the site of the waterhole at GPS coordinates: -24.074923, 15.887410.

_"NamibiaCam’s Namib Desert waterhole lies within the Gondwana Namib Park - bordering the Namib Naukluft Park. Built in 2006, the special character of this waterhole, has not only an impact on the surrounding wildlife, but stretches across the globe, from home to home through live streaming. This particular waterhole is situated within an open plain, 8km from Namib Desert Lodge. A solar-powered borehole fills a nearby reservoir and is monitored by a water float that opens as the waterhole’s levels decline. Being situated within a remote destination like the Namib Desert, intermittent interruptions are likely to occur at times."_
